  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Instructions: rewrite this page by adding a few sentences about yourself. Follow the instructions in README.md to turn it in.</p>

<p>My name is Davon and (as I've learned) I'm younger than Napster.</p>
<p>I graduated college about a year ago with a bachelor's in Comp Sci.</p>
<p>While my current place of work does host a website, my main interest in this curriculum is personal rather than professional. Looking forward to learning more!</p>
